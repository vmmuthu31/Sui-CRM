# Quilt: Walrus Native Batch Store Tool

URL: https://docs.wal.app/docs/system-overview/quilt

Quilt is a batch storage feature, designed to optimize the storage cost and efficiency of large numbers of small blobs **Blob** Single unstructured data object stored on Walrus. . Prior to Quilt, storing small blobs (less than 10 MB) on Walrus involved higher per-byte costs due to internal system data overhead. Quilt addresses this by encoding multiple (up to 666 for QuiltV1) blobs into a single unit called a **quilt** , significantly reducing Walrus storage overhead and lowering costs to purchase Walrus and Sui storage, as well as Sui computation gas fees.

Importantly, each blob within a quilt can be accessed and retrieved individually without needing to download the entire quilt. Moreover, the blob boundaries in a quilt align with Walrus internal structures and Walrus storage nodes **Storage node** Entity storing data for Walrus; holds one or several *shards*. , allowing for retrieval latency that is comparable to, or even lower than, that of a regular blob .

Quilt introduces custom, immutable Walrus-native blob metadata **Blob metadata** Metadata of one blob; in particular, this contains a hash per shard to enable the authentication of slivers and recovery symbols. , allowing you to assign different types of metadata to each blob in a quilt, for example, unique identifiers and tags of key-value pairs. This metadata is functionally similar to the existing blob metadata store on-chain, however, there are some fundamental distinctions. First, Walrus-native metadata is stored alongside the blob data, and hence it reduces costs and simplifies management. Second, this metadata can be used for efficient lookup of blobs within a quilt, for example, reading blobs with a particular tag. When storing a quilt, you can set the Walrus-native metadata using the Quilt APIs.

warning
An identifier must start with an alphanumeric character contain no trailing whitespace, and not exceed 64 KB in length.

The total size of all tags combined must not exceed 64 KB.

## Important considerations

Blobs stored in a quilt are assigned a unique ID, called `QuiltPatchId` , that differs from the `BlobId` used for regular Walrus blobs . A `QuiltPatchId` is determined by the composition of the entire quilt, rather than the single blob , and hence it can change if the blob is stored in a different quilt. Moreover, individual blobs cannot be deleted, extended, or shared separately. These operations can only be applied to the entire quilt.

## Target use cases

Using Quilt requires minimal additional effort beyond standard procedures. The primary considerations are that the unique ID assigned to each blob within a quilt cannot be directly derived from its contents.

### Lower cost

Quilt is especially advantageous for managing large volumes of small blobs , as long as they can be grouped together by the user **User** Any entity or person that wants to store or read blobs on or from Walrus; can act as a Walrus client itself or use the simple interface exposed by publishers and caches. . The cost savings come from 2 sources:

- **Walrus storage and write fees** : By consolidating multiple small blobs into a single quilt, storage costs can be reduced dramatically, more than 400x for files around 10 KB, making it an efficient solution for cost-sensitive applications.
- **Sui computation and object storage fees** : Storing many blobs as a single quilt significantly reduces Sui gas costs. In test runs with 600 files stored in a quilt, 238x savings in Sui fees were observed compared to storing them as individual blobs . Notably, Sui cost savings only depend on the number of files per quilt rather than the individual file sizes.
The following table demonstrates the potential cost savings in WAL **WAL** The native token of Walrus. when storing 600 small blobs for 1 epoch as a quilt compared to storing them as separate blobs .

| Blob size | Regular blob storage cost | Quilt storage cost | Cost saving factor 
| 10KB | 2.088 WAL | 0.005 WAL | 409x 
| 50KB | 2.088 WAL | 0.011 WAL | 190x 
| 100KB | 2.088 WAL | 0.020 WAL | 104x 
| 200KB | 2.088 WAL | 0.036 WAL | 58x 
| 500KB | 2.136 WAL | 0.084 WAL | 25x 
| 1MB | 2.208 WAL | 0.170 WAL | 13x 

info
The costs shown in this table are for illustrative purposes only and were obtained from test runs on Walrus Testnet. Actual costs can vary due to changes in smart contract parameters, networks, and other factors. The comparison is between storing 600 files as a single quilt versus storing them as individual blobs in batches of 25.

### Organize collections

Quilt provides a straightforward way to organize and manage collections of small blobs within a single unit. This can simplify data handling and improve operational efficiency when working with related small files, such as NFT image collections.

### Walrus native blob metadata

Quilt supports immutable, custom metadata stored directly in Walrus, including identifiers and tags. These features facilitate better organization, enable flexible lookup, and assist in managing blobs within each quilt, enhancing retrieval and management processes.
