# Quilt HTTP APIs

URL: https://docs.wal.app/docs/http-api/quilt-http-apis

Walrus supports storing and retrieving multiple blobs **Blob** Single unstructured data object stored on Walrus. as a single unit called a [quilt](/docs/system-overview/quilt) . Publishers and aggregators both support quilt operations.

### Storing quilts

All query parameters available for storing regular blobs can also be used when storing quilts.

Use the following publisher **Publisher** Service interacting with Sui and the storage nodes to store blobs on Walrus; offers a basic `HTTP POST` endpoint to end users. API to store multiple blobs as a quilt.

```sh
# Store 2 files `document.pdf` and `image.png`, with custom identifiers `contract-v2` and `logo-2024`, respectively:
$ curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/quilts?epochs=5" \
  -F "contract-v2=@document.pdf" \
  -F "logo-2024=@image.png"
```

Identifiers must be unique within a quilt and cannot start with `_` . The field name `_metadata` is reserved for Walrus native metadata and does not conflict with user **User** Any entity or person that wants to store or read blobs on or from Walrus; can act as a Walrus client itself or use the simple interface exposed by publishers and caches. -defined identifiers. See the [Quilt documentation](/docs/system-overview/quilt) for complete identifier restrictions.

```sh
# Store 2 files with Walrus-native metadata. `_metadata` must be used as the field name for Walrus native metadata
$ curl -X PUT "$PUBLISHER/v1/quilts?epochs=5" \
  -F "quilt-manual=@document.pdf" \
  -F "logo-2025=@image.png" \
  -F '_metadata=[
    {"identifier": "quilt-manual", "tags": {"creator": "walrus", "version": "1.0"}},
    {"identifier": "logo-2025", "tags": {"type": "logo", "format": "png"}}
  ]'
```

The quilt store API returns a JSON response with information about the stored quilt, including the quilt ID ( `blobId` ) and individual blob patch IDs that can be used to retrieve specific blobs later. The following example shows the command and response. The actual JSON output is returned as a single line and is formatted on this page for readability:

```sh
$ curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:31415/v1/quilts?epochs=1" \
  -F "walrus.jpg=@./walrus-33.jpg" \
  -F "another_walrus.jpg=@./walrus-46.jpg"
```

If successful, the console responds:

```sh
{
  "blobStoreResult": {
    "newlyCreated": {
    "blobObject": {
        "id": "0xe6ac1e1ac08a603aef73a34328b0b623ffba6be6586e159a1d79c5ef0357bc02",

### Reading quilts

You can retrieve blobs from a quilt through the aggregator **Aggregator** Service that reconstructs blobs by interacting with storage nodes and exposes a basic `HTTP GET` endpoint to end users. APIs using their quilt patch ID or their quilt ID and unique identifier. Currently, only 1 blob can be retrieved per request. Bulk retrieval of multiple blobs from a quilt in a single request is not yet supported.

##### Quilt patch ID

Each blob in a quilt has a unique patch ID. You can retrieve a specific blob using its patch ID.

```sh
# Retrieve a blob using its quilt patch ID:
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-quilt-patch-id/6XUOE-Q5-nAXHRifN6n9nomVDtHZQbGuAkW3PjlBuKoBAQDQAA" \
```

You can obtain `QuiltPatchIds` from the store quilt output or by using the [`list-patches-in-quilt`](/docs/walrus-client/storing-blobs#batch-store) CLI command.

##### Quilt ID and identifier

You can also retrieve a blob using the quilt ID and the blob 's identifier.

```sh
# Retrieve a blob with identifier `walrus.jpg` from the quilt:
$ curl "$AGGREGATOR/v1/blobs/by-quilt-id/6XUOE-Q5-nAXHRifN6n9nomVDtHZQbGuAkW3PjlBuKo/walrus.jpg" \
```

Both methods return the raw blob bytes in the response body. Metadata such as the blob ID **Blob ID** Cryptographic ID computed from a blob's slivers. and tags are returned as HTTP headers:

- `X-Quilt-Patch-Identifier` : The identifier of the blob within the quilt
- `ETag` : The patch ID or quilt ID for caching purposes
- Additional custom headers from blob tags, if configured
